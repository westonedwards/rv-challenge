The Challenge
The attached zip contains a series of PSD files and supporting assets that illustrate how the page should look upon completion. Your challenge is to render this design as a fully functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page should render perfectly in (at minimum) latest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. We encourage you to make this as interactive and creative as possible.

  Any JavaScript frameworks are allowed (We love to see Vanilla solutions too!).
  Page should be responsive for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
  Dealers section should be built using the provided JSON file.
